# Kinoko Mushroom

For the uninformed, the title is mushroom mushroom essentially.
Tiny program for compiling small rust projects.

Cargo does a lot and I don't get it, nor do I care to understand much about it as of the writing of this, so in retaliation for simplicity I wrote a thin wrapper over rustc for building small CLI applications that could be written in bash if I knew how to write a for loop in it.
It's unclear whether this project's scope will grow.

TODO:
- [ ] Be able to "init" a project
- [ ] Be able to change the target name/path through the CLI
- [ ] Be able to change the source through the CLI
- [ ] Be able to run tests like cargo
- [ ] Be able to clear out kinoko and setup cargo for transitioning
